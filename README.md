# Gerrit image comparison helper

This is a quick and dirty helper for comparing images in Gerrit. 

Note that you should enable image side-by-side comparison in Gerrit first, via the [mimetype.*.safe configuration](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#_a_id_mimetype_a_section_mimetype).

Can be used as a bookmarklet or included in the HTML.

Very much a prototype at the moment, to figure out what would be useful.
